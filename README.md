# WorkAssist 

This app is aimed to help customers find any kind of workers in their locality for at-home services like plumbing, technician, sofa cleaners, cleaning, repair & maintenance, beauty & wellness etc.

This platform provides two different interfaces for the workers  and the customers. Workers need to sign up with an ID, provide their work specifications, specify their locality details, and mark their status based on their availability.

while Customers can search for the required service and book the service with a worker member of their own liking. The Worker is tracked while the service is in progress.

## These are some of the screenshots of the application
